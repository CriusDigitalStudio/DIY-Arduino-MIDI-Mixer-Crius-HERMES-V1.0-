# DIY-Arduino-MIDI-Mixer-Crius-HERMES-V1.0-
The Crius “HERMES” MIDI Mixer consists of 8 potentiometers and 11 buttons with which we can control parameters of the VST-Plugin or DAW we play music 
and 32 LEDs divided into 4 columns (i.e. 8 LEDs for each track) that show us live the Volume value of each track within the DAW program by turning on the corresponding LEDs in each column.

Of the 11 buttons, 8 can be assigned to any DAW parameter we want.
The 2 of the 11 buttons are BANK buttons allow us to assign the 8 potentiometers to 8 more parameters as if we were changing "page" and have 16 potentiometers in 2 "pages".
Finally, there is another button with which we change the effect of the LEDs from "bar" filling to "moving dot" depending on the Volume value.


This is the PCB Design I made with Fritzing for the project circuit :
